ðŸš§ Work in progress.

A tiny Tensor-based Autograd engine with a PyTorch like API on top of it. Potentially useful for educational purposes, as it teaches me a lot building it.

Built on top of [micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd) by [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy). Many thanks to him for his teachings.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/palazski/macrograd.git
```
```bash
cd macrograd
```

```bash
pip install .
```

pypi package will be available when the package is ready.
